# Configuration for Staff Chat Bungee 1.0.0 by Jake
#

# The only thing to configure is how you want the staff chat to display.
# It's very straightforward. Simply edit he contents of the following quotations ("") and make the message look how you wish.
# Omitting any "%" sections will not cause any errors, it will simply remove the specified item from the message, so feel free to modify the format
# as you see fit. It's completely your decision. Have fun!

format: "&c[%timestamp] {Staff} [%server] %user : %message"

# The below only applies if you opt to include a time-stamp in the message. You will need to reference: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html for
# information on what to put here. The default should be fairly straightforward if you take a look at the above link.

timestamp-format: "MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss"
